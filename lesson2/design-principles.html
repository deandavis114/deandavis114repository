            <p>Amazon obviously wants its users to buy its products. Recently Amazon redesigned the layout of its page
                to focus on the Amazon exclusive products such as, Fire TV and the Echo product line. Your eyes are
                immediately drawn to these products. The next thing that you may notice is the search bar that takes up
                the top portion of the screen. </p>

            <p>The high contrast of the bright green bar against the blue bar beneath it allow Photography Mad to grab
                your attention. It is obvious that the bright green bar is trying to communicate something the sites
                designers what the viewer to notice</p>

            <p>FaceBook is famous for its lack of color and its focus white space. When using either the desktop or
                smartphone app the use of white space is obviously deliberate. FaceBook is an information giant and its
                layout emphasizes this. The whitespace allows you to focus on the images, comments, and “likes” of the posts
                in the newsfeed.</p>
